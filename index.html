    										Nick has time and time again demonstrated an invaluable ability to identify opportunities where others see none. At Bionic, he led the Energy Team (our leading product) towards realising all of our objectives, made sure we all have a clear understanding of the strategies we are pursuing and strived to create an environment where healthy debates are valued and the best choices for the business prevail. I can also confidently say that Nick is genuinely passionate about delivering quality products that both serve our users and meet our company's objectives.<br></p>

                        I worked with Nick during my time at Bionic and it was a pleasure to work with him. Nick is a great innovator and creative, he is able to see opportunities for product where others cannot. A strong leader and friend rather than a 'Boss' to his team. Nick is always willing to go the extra mile and has the ability to juggle many tasks simultaneous whilst always adding value and bringing vision to his product and support to his team, I would say he is a multi-faceted individual. Working together we always took the collaborative approach for delivery and this is a strength that I really appreciated, it is what I feel made the team work so well and deliver so efficiently. <br></p>

                                        Nick was a focused, thorough and committed part of Packt’s Senior Management Team. I worked with Nick for the last 18 months in his role as Head of eCommerce & Conversion and have observed his growth and ownership within his Senior Product Manager role.
    Nick has helped to drive forward many of Packt’s eCommerce product propositions during a rapid growth period, many of which have been successfully implemented into our business structure. As a trusted and friendly colleague, I thoroughly enjoyed working with Nick, and, after 5 years service with Packt, he was certainly well thought of within his own team and the wider business.
    His passion and enthusiasm in his role shines through <br></p>
