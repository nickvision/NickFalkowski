  <h2 id="gto">Grasping the Ouroboros</h2>
<p><br>
I’ll take the kiss of the current flares to <br>
Hold my light from escaping<br>
<br>
Too swift before the drums despite<br>
Youth's myths ever fading with<br>
<br>
The oompah band of this continuous absurdity.<br>
I’ll make these decisions righteous as <br>
<br>
The ever righteous; God my only<br>
Barometer in these inclement times.<br>
<br>
Certain in this uncertainty I strive again to strike<br>
Apart the very foundations of my doubt, for <br>
<br>
To be content with this discontent may yet <br>
Herald the dawning of a certain kind<br>
<br>
Of peace, or at least a masquerade at light<br>
Pretty enough that it may in turn fool enough <br>
<br>
For long enough to make it surely enough<br>
That the whole thing might feel somewhat <br>
<br>
Bearable. Yet still I feel like Barabus spared <br>
Only to inherit a millennia of condemnation: <br>
<br>
Speared forever upon a crescendo of deepest longing. <br>
The present presents little respite or salve here for<br>
<br>
The cuts the future currents carve through <br>
My every thought of what it will take to <br>
<br>
Continue to move so as to still breathe without<br>
Giving my true position away - timid mouse<br>
<br>
In a hovel of words, I preserve myself by<br>
These sickly diatribes against the flagrant<br>
<br>
Countenance with which this universe has chosen <br>
To present itself to me; knowing that in saying that <br>
<br>
I can’t escape the horrid shape my craven <br>
Craving has long carved it into - guilty at <br>
<br>
The foot of the cross I know I’m surely <br>
Lost, destined to carry on so, long and along,<br>
<br>
Belligerent and begrudging, until I<br>
Die; and in forgetting am forgotten. <br>

  <p><br>
  I take note of the one taking notes   <br>
  Outside the back of the bushes, smiling  <br>
<br>
  Innocuously? That grin borders   <br>
  On incoherence. I’ve inherited more  <br>
    <br>
  Anxiety than you could know; unless   <br>
  You know, of course, and so we must  <br>
    <br>
  Dance always far enough apart so as to  <br>
  Trip each other only minorly, the great   <br>
    <br>
  Artistic collapse having little to speak for itself   <br>
  Besides its own infallible fury that furnishes  <br>
    <br>
  The room within which one can feel suitably   <br>
  Tortured. But I’m not the one here raising   <br>
    <br>
  Torches - this monster has become as kin  <br>
  To me, a subject so akin to those writings   <br>
    <br>
  That ramble down the rabbit holes of purposeful   <br>
  Purposelessness. Another great thrust follows   <br>
    <br>
  Into a space whose only response is to call absently    <br>
  For more; and more; with no reward returned   <br>
    <br>
  To the resolve that first took the plunge, except   <br>
  More depths, more darkness, and the maddening     <br>
      <br>
  Momentum to somehow carry itself on, striking   <br>
  Desperate matches only to be  <br>
    <br>
  Lost inconsolably within moments of taking   <br>
  Light, absorbed by the whole of the hole this   <br>
    <br>
  Searching has irrevocably torn through   <br>
  The pretty patchwork of the world we   <br>
    <br>
  Slept so softly underneath, obliviously   <br>
  Dreaming we knew meaning, could   <br>
    <br>
  Account for all the hardships and   <br>
  The headaches, knowing intuitively   <br>
    <br>
  The intricacy with which this world is fashioned;  <br>
  The celestial watch ticking to a time which   <br>
    <br>
  We felt we could cohere, if only we might but   <br>
  Pierce the firmament that has kept us held   <br>
    <br>
  Safe below the high heavens, gazing ever   <br>
  Upwards, watched down upon by some   <br>
    <br>
  Unique intelligence, not unlike our own, yet  <br>
  So unlike our own as to make all of this  <br>
    <br>
  Impossibility somehow possible - filling us  <br>
  With apostolistic intent to spread a message  <br>
    <br>
  To those so frantically grasping that they now   <br>
  Could relax their grip. But that artifice will   <br>
      <br>
  Not outlive ourselves. Rather than a clock  <br>
  We should have built a lock with which  <br>
    <br>
  To hold down and back all our wondering  <br>
  For it shall always eventually extend far beyond   <br>
    <br>
  The extent of our knowledge, wandering    <br>
  Into that place beyond time and space  <br>
    <br>
  Where meaning hangs upon a rope tugged  <br>
  Heavier the harder you struggle now to    <br>
    <br>
  Wriggle free - for beyond that promise is a fear   <br>
  Far greater than that of death - that there is  <br>
    <br>
  In fact behind it all nothing quite  <br>
  Behind it all, except this person   <br>
    <br>
  Barely known to us, fully one   <br>
  With us, sitting back, smiling,   <br>
    <br>
  Taking down notes on our movements  <br>
  As we drift onwards through the void.   <br>
